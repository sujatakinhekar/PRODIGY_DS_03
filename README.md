Problem Statement: Build a decision tree classifier to predict whether a customer will purchase a product or service based on their demographic and behavioral data. Use a dataset such as the Bank Marketing dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

In this project, we builded decision tree classifier to predict whether a customer will purchase a product or service based on their demographic and behavioral data. Dataset used is related with direct marketing campaigns of a Portuguese banking institution. The marketing campaigns were based on phone calls. Often, more than one contact to the same client was required, in order to access if the product (bank term deposit) would be ('yes') or not ('no') subscribed.

KEY TAKEAWAYS AND INSIGHTS:

The process of building and evaluating a Decision Tree Classifier involves several key steps. Let's summarize:

1)Data Preparation: Split your dataset into features(X) and labels(y). Ensure your data is clean and suitable for training a classifier.
Model Training: Create a Decision Tree Classifier using scikit-learn's 'DecisionTreeClassifier'. Train the model on your traning dataset using the 'fit' model.
2)Hyperparameter Tuning: Explore different hyperparameter values using techniques like grid search('GridSearchCV') to find the optimal set.Common hyperparameters include 'max_depth', 'min_samples_split', 'min_samples_leaf', and 'criterion'.
3)Evaluation: Assess model's performance using metrices such as accuracy, precision, recall, and the confusion matrix. Use accuracy_score for an overall measure of correct predictions.
4)Cross-Validation: Use cross-validation('cross_val_score') to get a more robust estimate of your model's performance across different subsets of your data.
5)Visualization: Visualize the Decision Tree structure using 'plot_tree' for an intuitive understanding of how the model makes decisions.
6)Insights and Interpretations: Analyze the confusion matrix to understand where the model excels and where it struggles. Consider feature importance, which can be obtained from the feature_importances_attribute of the trained model.
